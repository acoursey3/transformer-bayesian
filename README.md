# Transformers Can Do Bayesian Inference
Paper Presentation by Austin Coursey
## Overview
### Motivation
Let's consider a situation.
- A casino publishes data on winnings
- They send out a survey to the recent visitors who they have contact information for
- "8 out of the 10 people who responded actually made money!"
- Likelihood of making money given data follows (Binomial likelihood):

$$p(\theta|D)={10 \choose 8}\theta^8(1-\theta)^{2}$$
